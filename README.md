# Situational Awareness Modeling in AR-Guided CPR
This is the official code repository for the paper to be presented at IEEE ISMAR 2025, titled "**Will You Be Aware?

## Overview
![Overview](assets/teaser.png)
This work seeks to model situational awareness though eye tracking data captured on a Magic Leap 2 device, in an AR app designed for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) guidance. To evaluate situational awareness, we designed two realistic, unexpected incidents, i.e. the patient bleeding or vomiting during the CPR procedure, to observe the participants' response. Based on their responses we label them with good or poor SA labels and trained a graph neural network that predicts such label at 83% accuracy.

## Video Demonstration
Check the video below (simply click on the image!) for how we setup our experiment and how the incidents look in the AR view. A brief introduction of our modeling method is also included in the video.

## Code Base Introduction
The code base consists of three main modules: the [gaze extraction and classic ML module](gaze_extraction), the (baseline) [PatchTSMixer module](time_series_modeling) (thanks to George Zerveas et al. for open sourcing their [code](https://github.com/gzerveas/mvts_transformer), from which we built a part of the model training/testing workflow), and the [FixGraphPool module](fix_graph_pool_modeling). The recommanded workflow (and so was our workflow) is to first compile raw collected gaze data through the gaze extraction module, and then run preprocessing code on gaze extraction output to run the different models. 

**Please note that due to IRB requirements we are not able to release the data.** Instead, we provide *example data files* corresponding to visual behavior of one of the authors in [my_data](my_data).

For more details of code usage, please refer to seperate README files in each module.
